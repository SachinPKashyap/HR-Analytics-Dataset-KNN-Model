**"HR Analytics: Job Change of Employees"**

This dataset focuses on identifying which candidates are likely to remain with the company after training and who are looking for new employment opportunities. 

This analysis helps reduce costs and time, improve training quality, and enhance the planning of courses and candidate categorization.

The dataset includes information related to demographics, education, and experience obtained from candidates during signup and enrollment. 

The target variable is binary, indicating whether an employee will leave (1) or not leave (0) the company.

**Model Performance:** The KNN model achieved an Accuracy (ACR) of 0.9246, which indicates that the model correctly predicted around 92.46% of the test data. This is a strong accuracy level, suggesting that the model is performing well in general.

**Sensitivity vs. Specificity:** The Sensitivity (TPR) of the model is 0.7767, which means that 77.67% of the actual positive cases were correctly identified. On the other hand, the Specificity (TNR) is 0.9738, indicating that the model correctly identified 97.38% of the actual negative cases. This shows that the model is better at predicting employees who will stay (i.e., it has a higher true negative rate) compared to those who will leave.
